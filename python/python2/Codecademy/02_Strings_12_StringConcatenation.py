# Print the concatenation of "Spam and eggs" on line 3!

print ("Spam " + "and " + "eggs")

"""The + operator between strings will ‘add’ them together, one after the other. 
Notice that there are spaces inside the quotation marks after Life 
and of so that we can make the combined string look like 3 words.
Combining strings together like this is called concatenation."""
