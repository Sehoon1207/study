Summary

We’ve covered many important topics:

Structures allow you to create user-defined data types
Structures can package together other data types into one type
You can define a structure using the struct keyword
When defining a structure, the member variables are declared but not instantiated
Structures help programs work with complex data and can represent real-world objects
You can access member variables with the dot operator
You can have a pointer to a structure and access its member variables using the arrow operator
You can pass structures and structure pointers to functions
You can return structures from functions
With our understanding of structures, we can now create and work with complicated data types easily and efficiently.
