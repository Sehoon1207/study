To access member variables with bottlePointer and the dot operator we can use the following syntax:

(*bottlePointer).name;
(*bottlePointer).maxCapacity;
(*bottlePointer).currentCapacity;

Arrow notation can also be used with pointers to structures, as it implicitly does the dereferencing for you.

aPointer->name;
aPointer->maxCapacity;
aPointer->currentCapacity;
