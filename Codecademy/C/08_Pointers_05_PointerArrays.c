Pointers & Arrays
In the lesson on arrays, you learned that an array is a contiguous block of memory reserved for many variables of the same type. Because of this structured organization, a pointer is well suited to work with this data type. If we have an integer array, we can use pointers and pointer arithmetic to iterate through the array to access or manipulate its values. This might seem like an overcomplicated way to work with arrays, but there are some advanced applications in which working with an array through a pointer is necessary.

Consider an array of integers arr. Since arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, if we have a pointer to the first element, we can use pointer arithmetic to access the rest of the array. Keep in mind that while this is a valid way to work with arrays, it is unsafe. Accessing memory outside of the bounds of the array will not cause a program crash, but will silently corrupt data stored in those addresses. In the case of a read operation, it will return a random value.
